## Housekeeping


- No office hours tomorrow and Monday moved to noon
- Questions from Monday? 


## Ideas from Monday

- Liebig's law of the minimum 

- Redfield ratio

- co-dependence of all nutrient cycles

- Many of the reactions that govern this co-dependence are 
redox reactions

4Fe$_{(s)}$ + 3O$_2$ $->$ 2Fe$_2$O$_{3s}$

## Rules of redox

- Reduction/oxidation reactions
- Electrons are exchanged from one atom to another
- Atoms that gain electrons are called *reduced* 
- Atoms that lose electrons are called *oxidized*
- Oxidation Is Loss Reduction Is Gain of electrons (OIL-RIG)

## Breaking down a redox reaction

4Fe$_{(s)}$ + 3O$_2$ $->$ 2Fe$_2$O$_{3s}$

## Oxidative state (or oxidation number)

- A simplified way of keeping track of electrons
- Follow the rules to figure it out:


## Rule 1 

- If single element (or self-bonded element)-oxidation state of 0

<img src='https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2e/Simple_Periodic_Table_Chart-en.svg/1200px-Simple_Periodic_Table_Chart-en.svg.png>

- O$_2$, H$_2$, Al, Ag, Hg, Fl$_2$

## Rule 2

- Monatomic ions have oxidation state of their charge

- Na$^+$, Cl$^-$

## Rule 3

- Alkali metals (far left of periodic table) = +1 oxidation number

## Rule 3 (bonus)

## Rule 4

- Alkaline metals (second from left on periodic table) have oxidation number of +2

## Rule 5

- Hydrogen is +1 when bonded to a non-metal
- Hydrogen is -1 when bonded to a metal

## Rule 6

- Oxygen is almost always -2
- Unless it is in a peroxide it is -1 (H$_2$O$_2$)

## Rule 7

- Fluorine is always -1

## Rule 8

- Sum of oxidation numbers in a molecule is zero or the 
charge of the molecule. 

- NaCl, SO$_4^{2-}$
