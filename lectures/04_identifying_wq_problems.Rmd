## Housekeeping

- Tools for class
- Questions from Monday?
- HW reminder

## Goals for today

- Build an understanding of how we historically have found land-use -> WQ problems (non-pathogen)

- Review watershed ecosystem concept as a modern primary tool for understanding 
WQ change.

## Historic stages of water quality impacts? 

- In antiquity and modernity, increased erosion and nutrient loading is a land-use change -> water quality bellweather

- Since the 1900s, many of these impacts have been discovered and understood
through the lens of watershed biogeochemistry 

## Why is this lake filling with sediment?

## Very brief timeline

- ~ 2000 years ago, sedimentation in Roman lakes

- ~ 500 years ago, sedimentation in Venice lagoon and other european estuaries
  - subsequent rerouting rivers, a common theme in dealing with water quality issues)
  
- Beginning of modern watershed science in 1900s in [Switzerland](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/002216949390111L) and [Wagon Wheel Gap, CO](https://www.nap.edu/read/5589/chapter/5#27)

## Watershed (catchment) studies

<img src='http://www.history-of-hydrology.net/mediawiki/images/2/22/Wagon_Wheel_Gap_Photo.jpg'>

- All early catchment studies were motivied by a growing understanding of the link 
between deforestation, flooding, and sedimentation

- These early studies in 1910 in Colorado and many more through 1958 almost 
entirely studied [water quantity change and erosion](http://coweeta.uga.edu/publications/swank_88_streamflow.pdf)

## Watershed ecosystem studies {.build}

- [Tansley 1935](https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.2307/1930070)
	
*a particular category of physical systems, consisting of organisms and inorganic components in a relatively stable equilibrium, open and of various sizes and kinds*
  
- Making a watershed the ecosystem unit is a powerful tool [tool](https://www.esf.edu/cue/documents/Bormann-Likens_Nutrient-Cycling_1967_000.pdf)


## Hubbard Brook

- Herb Bormann and Gene Likens

- Critically important approach that has been replicated 100s of times
