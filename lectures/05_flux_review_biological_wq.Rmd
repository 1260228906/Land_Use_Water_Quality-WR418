## Housekeeping

- HW for next week will be posted after class
- Questions from Wednesday? 
- Finish watershed biogeochemistry section

## Watershed Biogeochemisty at Hubbard Brook

- Acid Rain
- Deforestation
- Ice Storm
- Dilutification
- Calcium experiment


## What's the flux? 

- the action or process of flowing or flowing out
- the rate of transfer of fluid, particles, or energy across a given surface

## Flux of energy

## Flux of water quality?

- Hydrology is the study of water generally
- Biogeochemistry, hydrology, ecology, toxicology and many other fields all study water quality
- For some of these fields [concentration] is the key water quality feature
- For others, the flux of a contaminant matters more
- How do we calculate contaminant flux? 

## Waterborne pathogens

## Cholera

- John Snow discovered source of Cholera at Broad Street Pump in 1854
- Filippo Pacini discovered cholera in 1854 in Italy, 
- Robert Koch rediscovered it 30 years later 
- Why all in the 1850s?

*Nearly 4% of the global disease burden could be prevented by improving water supply*
