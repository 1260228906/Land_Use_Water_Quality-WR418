## Housekeeping

- HW for next week will be posted after class
- Questions from Wednesday? 
- Finish watershed biogeochemistry section

## Watershed Biogeochemisty at Hubbard Brook

- Acid Rain
- Deforestation
- Ice Storm
- Dilutification
- Calcium experiment


## What's the flux? 

- the action or process of flowing or flowing out
- the rate of transfer of fluid, particles, or energy across a given surface

## Flux of energy

## Flux of water quality?

- Hydrology is the study of water generally
- Biogeochemistry, hydrology, ecology, toxicology and many other fields all study water quality
- For some of these fields [concentration] is the key water quality feature
- For others, the flux of a contaminant matters more
- How do we calculate contaminant flux? 

## Waterborne pathogens

## Cholera

- John Snow discovered source of Cholera at Broad Street Pump in 1854
- Filippo Pacini discovered cholera in 1854 in Italy, 
- Robert Koch rediscovered it 30 years later 
- Why all in the 1850s?

## Cholera (cont.)

- Still a problem in many parts of the world
- Dynamics are closely tied to [people and water cycles](https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/109/17/6602.full.pdf)



## E. coli

- Discovered in 1885 by Theodor Escherich
- One of the most well-studied organisms on earth
- Still causes more than 100,000 illnesses in USA every year


## E. coli

## It's almost 2020

- What pathogenic water quality problems have we solved?
- Why do so many persist? 

## Homework

- Find a primary literature article about a water quality problem, you can look for really modern work on contaminants, historic work on e.coli, or ancient paleoecology articles on a water qualiyt problem. 

- Read the article and answer the following questions in less than 250 words:

- What water quality problem do the authors identify?
- What techniques did the authors use to identify the problem? (laboratory chemical analysis, models, historc reconstruction, etc...)
- Does the water quality impact mostly affect people, the environment, or both? 
- For how long has this water quality problem existed? 
- Do the authors propose any solutions? If so, what are they? If not, what do you think might be a solution?
