# Chemical weathering and acididity

The ultimate source of many nutrients key to life come from the 
chemical weathering of bedrock, or the dissolving of solid parent material into
its component elements of base cations, anions, metals, and other trace elements.
Chemical weathering happens when water, filled with organic, carbonic, and
other acids, reaches bedrock, which it slowly dissolves. Humans have profoundly 
altered weathering rates across the world, by increasing the amount of acidity
in rain, streamwater, and from mining. Increasing chemical weathering rates
mobilizes more cations and anions along with other metals and trace elements, 
increasing their concentrations in freshwaters. 

As with previous lessons, the folks at Crash Course have built a series of videos
that provide an excellent review of the key chemistry ideas that govern chemical
weathering rates and how humans have altered these rates. 

## Acid rain

One of the most profound and widespread impacts people have had on chemical 
weathering rates is by increasing the acidity of rain. Essentially, combustion of
coal and other fossil fuels, releases $NO_x$ and $SO_x$ compounds, which interact
with water vapor to form the strong acids: nitric and sulfuric acid. 
Higher acidity from these compounds leads to higher weathering rates 
(or in the case of the video, higher statue-melting rates).

### pH review

One critical idea when working in acid-base chemistry is the idea of a pH scale
(and it's inverse the pOH scale). The video below explains this idea quite clearly.

## Buffers

One way to lessen the impact of adding a strong acid or base to a solution is to 
buffer the system with weak acid and bases. The nuts and bolts of buffered 
solutions is explained in the below video.

## The carbonate equilibrium buffer

In natural waters the most important buffer is the carbonate equilibrium system
whereby $CO_2$ dissolves into solution forming both $HCO_3^-$ and $H_2CO_3$. 
Excess $HCO_3^-$ in natural waters acts as a natural buffer, limiting the
impact of additonal acids being added to the system. Other buffers exisit in
natural systems and the sum of their ability to absorb incoming acids is called:
**Alkalinity**. 

This [paper](http://www.chem1.com/acad/pdf/c3carb.pdf) by Stephen Lower goes into 
much more detail about the carbonate equilibrium system, alkalinity, and natural 
waters. You should review this in addition to watching the above videos. 

## Acid-mine drainage

Acid-mine drainage is a human-induced change to natural waters 
that can completely override any alkalinity in the system
and dramatically reduce the pH.
